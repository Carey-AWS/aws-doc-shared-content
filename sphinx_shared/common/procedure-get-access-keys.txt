Access keys consist of an *access key ID* and *secret access key*, which are used to sign
programmatic requests that you make to AWS. If you don't have access keys, you can create them by
using the |console|_. We recommend that you use IAM access keys instead of AWS root account access
keys. IAM lets you securely control access to AWS services and resources in your AWS account.

.. note:: To create access keys, you must have permissions to perform the required IAM actions. For
    more information, see `Granting IAM User Permission to Manage Password Policy and Credentials`__ in
    |iam-ug|.

**To get your access key ID and secret access key**

1. Open the IAM console.

2. From the navigation menu, click :guilabel:`Users`.

3. Select your IAM user name.

4. Click :guilabel:`User Actions`, and then click :guilabel:`Manage Access Keys`.

5. Click :guilabel:`Create Access Key`.

   Your keys will look something like this:

   * Access key ID example: ``AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE``

   * Secret access key example: ``wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY``

6. Click :guilabel:`Download Credentials`, and store the keys in a secure location.

.. important:: Your secret key will no longer be available through the AWS Management Console; you
    will have the only copy. Keep it confidential in order to protect your account, and never email it.
    Do not share it outside your organization, even if an inquiry appears to come from AWS or
    Amazon.com.  No one who legitimately represents Amazon will ever ask you for your secret key.
