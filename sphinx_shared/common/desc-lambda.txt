|LAMlong|_ is a compute service where you can upload your code to |LAM| and the service can run the
code on your behalf using AWS infrastructure. After you upload your code and create what we call a
*Lambda function*, |LAM| takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the
code.
